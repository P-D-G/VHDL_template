Just a VHDL template for use with ghdl and gtkwave. All sources are located in "sources" folder, all testbenches in "testbench", and all simulation .vcd files are put in "simulation" folder. To use, just run :
'''
make simulate top=top_module
'''
(with 'top_module' replaced by the name of your top module)
